    <h1 id="title">How to make an ommlete, for robots</h1>
    <p> When asked by a user if a robot can make scrambled eggs, typically
        a robot does not contain the necessary code to execute such a task.
        That's the reality of many robots manufactured today, failing over and over
        and encountering an average of 6 errors comprehending how eggs work.
        This tutorial will cover in robot terms how to scramble an egg, from walking into
        the kitchen to serving it.
    </p>
    <section>
        You will need the following items to produce scrambled eggs
        <ul>
            <li>14g cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 to 2 eggs depending on user hunger</li>
            <li>Cooking pan with handle</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
            <li>Serving plate</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean appendages via manufacturer recommended methods<br>
            <div class="warning">Warning <br>
            <p class="warning_text">Ensure cleaning process is food safe.  If not food clean, return user invalid process error.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Open refrigerator</li>
        <li>Retrieve eggs from refrigerator (or countertop if not mass produced)</li>
        <li>Close refrigerator</li>
        <li>Put pan on stove burner</li>
        <li>Turn on stove.  There are seperate instructions depending on model of stovetop.  Check user manual for stove if needed </li>
        <li>Put pan on stove, with concave side facing up and away from the burner <br>
            <div class="warning">Warning <p>
            <p class="warning_text">Do not leave any flamable objects by stove, nor people.  Doing so violates the first law of robotics and may result in termination</p>
        </li>
        <li>Wait aproximately 15 seconds</li>
        <li>Put oil in and lift pan slightly off</li>
        <li>Slowly translate pan on plane perpendicular to gravity to spread oil around pan</li>
        <li>Gently return pan to original position on burner</li>
        <li>Begin cracking egg by tapping it with about 4.4N of force</li>
        <li>Move egg over pan and seperate both sides.  An egg yolk should drop into the pan.</li>
            <div class="warning">Warning
                <p class="warning_text">If cracking egg produces chocolate instead of yolk, that's an easter egg.  Remove chocolate from pan and replace with another egg following instructions 2 and 3 and repeating this instruction </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Use spatula to cut yolk</li>
        <li>Use spatula to continuously move eggs and prevent burning</li>
        <li>Repeat above step until no liquid egg matter is present and eggs have reached an internal temperature of at least 158 degrees fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Remove pan from active burner</li>
        <li>Turn off stove</li>
        <li>Take pan and move it aproximately three inches above plate</li>
        <li>Rotate pan around handle aproximately 30 degrees clockwise if in left hand or counterclockwise if in right hand and use spatula to remove eggs from pan</li>
        <li>Return pan to empty stove on another burner to cool</li>
        <li>Set reminder to clean pan in approximately thirty minutes.  This is also when the pan will be cool</li>
        <li>Serve scrambled eggs</li>
    </ol>
